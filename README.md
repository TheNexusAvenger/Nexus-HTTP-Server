# Nexus HTTP Server
Nexus HTTP Server is a light-weight .NET HTTP server implementation
loosely based on concepts of setting up a server in the
[(Java Spark Microframework](http://sparkjava.com/). The goal is to
provide a very simple class library for abstracting handling HTTP
requests from clients.

## Documentation
Documentation for the class library can be found on the
[GitHub pages](https://thenexusavenger.github.io/Nexus-HTTP-Server)
for this project. The [docs folder](docs) can also be used since it has all
of the markdown files.

## .NET Compatibility
The class library targets .NET Standard 2.0. For creating applications,
.NET Framework v4.6.1 or .NET Core 2.0 or newer is required. Check compatibility
for other versions of .NET if you are going to use it with something
else (like Mono or Xaramin).

Nexus HTTP Server is available under the terms of the Apache 
Liscence 2.0. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
