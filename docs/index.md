# Nexus HTTP Server
Nexus HTTP Server is a light-weight .NET HTTP server implementation
loosely based on concepts of setting up a server in the
[http://sparkjava.com/](Java Spark Microframework). While not
fully featured like Java Spark or Spring Boot, the goal is to
provide a very simple class library for abstracting handling HTTP
requests from clients. This was originally implemneted in Nexus Git,
but was removed from the codebase for use in other applications.
